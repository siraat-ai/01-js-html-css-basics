# 🌩️ Mission: Cloud + AI  
### 2-Month Target — Learn Deep. Build Real. Show Strong.  

---

## 🧭 Phase 1 — Knowledge Go-Through (Month 1)
**Goal:** Master the essentials of AI integration, cloud architecture, and security — with conceptual clarity and implementation confidence.

| Week | Focus | Core Course | Key Outcomes |
|------|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Week 1** | **AI Integration Fundamentals** | *Building with OpenAI API (Packt)* | - Understand prompt engineering, embeddings, and API integration.<br>- Create sample scripts automating small workflows. |
| **Week 2** | **Cloud Architecture Design** | *Google Cloud Architect Certification* | - Learn scalability, compute, storage, IAM basics.<br>- Design a reference architecture for hosting AI services. |
| **Week 3** | **Cloud Security & Zero-Trust** | *Google Cloud Security Certification* | - Apply identity-based access control and secure API management.<br>- Understand encryption, compliance, and IAM roles. |
| **Week 4** | **Strategic Context** | *Digital Transformation Using AI/ML with Google Cloud* | - Learn how businesses adopt AI through cloud modernization.<br>- Connect your technical learning to enterprise transformation. |

**Deliverable (End of Month 1):**  
- A **study summary.md** capturing your understanding of each module.  
- A **system architecture diagram** outlining an intelligent cloud application you’ll build next month.
